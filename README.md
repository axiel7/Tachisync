Android app to sync Tachiyomi downloads on external devices (OTG only for now).

I made this app for personal use to easily transfer the Tachiyomi downloads to my Kobo eBook, but feel free to request new features or improvements!

Tested on Android 13 but it should work fine on Android 10+.
Untested on other Android versions, open an issue if it doesnâ€™t work.
